# Intern Developer Plus
The project is one of the challenges available in the [SF Academy](https://github.com/soluzionifutura/sf-academy).
This is my attempt.

## Installing
1. Clone the repository using GitHub CLI: ``` gh repo clone chillFil/sf-academy ```
2. Then simply start the app with Docker: ```docker compose up -d```
3. Connect to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and have fun!
